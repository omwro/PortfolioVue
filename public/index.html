Hey fellow curious developer.
My name is Omer Erdem and welcome to my portfolio website.
This website is build to introduce myself and show off my skills.
Ofcourse no website is perfect (unless it gets featured in awwwards) so hit me up for ideas or any improvements.

This website is build in Vue.js just for fun, extra experience and cleaner/easier folder structure as a followup from the previous angular portfolio website and older plain html/css/js website.
Website is still in development so 'prepare for trouble, make it double'.
